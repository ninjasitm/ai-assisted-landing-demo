- Ensure lint, test, and build pass before committing.
- Use Playwright for end-to-end tests (no unit test framework configured).
- Use Playwright for E2E tests of critical user flows.
- Place tests in `tests/e2e/` directory.
- Aim for meaningful test coverage of interactive features and critical user flows.
