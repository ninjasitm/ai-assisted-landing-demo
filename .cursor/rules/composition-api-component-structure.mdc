- Each page section is a distinct HTML component using semantic elements (e.g., `<section class="hero">`).
- Follow the HTML section pattern for all page components.
- Use clear and descriptive naming for CSS classes, IDs, and JavaScript functions.
- Keep logic within section handlers focused and manageable.
- Add code comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations.
- Use bracketed identifiers for logs: `[ComponentName]: message`.
