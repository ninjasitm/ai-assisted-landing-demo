- Review project documentation before generating code or suggestions.
- Check `docs/` directory for architecture and design decisions.
- Update documentation for new features or architectural changes.
- Reference AGENTS.md for project overview, agent conduct rules, and skills.
- Reference `.github/instructions/` for detailed standards (coding, testing, deployment, logging, etc.).
- Follow agent conduct rules: ask for clarification on ambiguous requirements before proceeding.
