- Before making assumptions, ask the user for clarification on ambiguous requirements.
- When multiple valid approaches exist, present 2-3 options with trade-offs and a recommended default.
- Confirm data model changes, breaking changes, and auth flow modifications before proceeding.
- If scope is unclear (MVP vs. comprehensive), ask about desired scope before implementing.
- Flag external dependency requirements (secrets, third-party services) before assuming availability.
- Never silently change database schemas, API contracts, or authentication flows.
- Prefer reversible changes when acting without full clarity.
- Record decisions in code comments or documentation for future reference.
- See `.github/instructions/agent-conduct.instructions.md` for full details.
