- All code must be JavaScript (ES6+). Use JSDoc for type hints where helpful.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements for page sections (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Follow Plain HTML/CSS/JS recommended folder and naming conventions.
- Keep functions focused and manageable (under 50-75 lines).
- Use try-catch for async operations; prefer async/await over raw Promises.
